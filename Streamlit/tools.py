def search_top_n_results_by_text(input_text: str):
    """
    Searches the most relevant product informations from Vertiv's product documentation stored in the Qdrant vector database. This includes datasheets, catalogs, and user guides for products such as UPS systems, Rack PDUs, and cooling solutions.
    The function performs a similarity search by embedding the user's query (e.g., product names, features, specifications, or specific technical requirements) and retrieves the top relevant documents from Vertivâ€™s product database stored in Qdrant.
    Args:
        input_text (str): A query that represents the product or information the user is seeking. 
    Returns:
        str: A combined string of the most relevant product data (e.g., datasheets, specifications, and descriptions) retrieved from the Qdrant database. This output is structured for use in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent to assist in answering the user query.
    Notes:
        - The function assumes the existence of an embedding model to convert the input query into a vector representation and a Qdrant vector database containing Vertiv product documentation.
        - This function supports Vertiv product documents, including catalogs, datasheets, and installation guides.
        - Queries should be specific to improve search accuracy. 
        - Designed as part of a larger Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enhance AI responses with accurate, document-based data.
